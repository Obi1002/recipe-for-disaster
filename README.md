<br>

**Introduction**

<br> 
Are you trapped in your home like the rest of us in the middle of this COVID pandemic? Finding it hard to get out to the store?  Wondering what you can do with the few ingredients that you have in your home?   Well we have, and that's why we developed Recipe for Disaster.

This app is designed to help you take this disastrous situation and make into a culinary work of art.

This application was designed to help users find recipes to cook based upon ingredients that they have readily available at home.   

<br>

**Method**

<br>
Once the user enters their available ingredients, as well as their dietary restrictions, desired cuisine type and let's the app know if they have any allergy concerns, this app will utilize several APIs, including Spoonacular, YouTube, and Giphy, to search for possible recipes as well as provide photos of the food and possible instructional how-to cooking videos.
